# Athlehub - Improvements & Current Features Summary

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. Jersey Number Validation Bug ✅
**Problem**: Jersey numbers were being validated across both teams instead of within the same team only.
**Solution**: Updated `PlayerManager.js` to check jersey number duplicates only within the current team.
**Impact**: Players can now have the same jersey number on opposing teams (which is correct).

### 2. Live Match Score Saving ✅
**Problem**: Live match scores weren't being saved to the database when matches ended.
**Solution**: Added `saveMatchAndExit()` function to `LiveMatchScreen.js` with proper database insertion.
**Impact**: Live match scores are now properly saved and appear in match history.

### 3. Profile Tab Navigation ✅
**Problem**: Old basic profile screen didn't match V3 UI standards.
**Solution**: Replaced with new `PlayerProfileScreen` featuring badges, statistics, and modern design.
**Impact**: Consistent V3 UI experience across all screens.

### 4. Account Management ✅
**Problem**: No proper account deletion or settings management.
**Solution**: Created comprehensive `SettingsScreen` with profile management and account options.
**Impact**: Users can now manage their profiles and account settings properly.
